# textAnalytics
Place to dump my R code for text analytics stuff. Blurb for each item below.


#### TEMPLATE WEBPAGE SCRAPER ####
This is a straightforward scraper, set as a function and looped. Required is a list of URLs and a node common between them. Writing to the output file is set as append, so if there isn't one common node, you can iterate through 2+ times.

I use this to scrape relevant pages of a website, in order to build up a corpus of texts from a particular sector.
